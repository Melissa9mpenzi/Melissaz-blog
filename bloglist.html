          <h4 class="card-title"><strong>WEEK ONE - Leadership</strong></h4>
          <p class="card-text">The leadership class was our very first class at refactory. In week one, our facilitator
            Ms. Julia Nansubuga gave us an introduction to the famous book "7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE" by
            Franklin Covey. We went into details of habits 1,2 and 3 during the classes and went as far as having
            discussions from the breakout rooms. They were very effective sessions as they gave every student room for
            participation.We definitely had emotional moments where our colleagues shared personal life stories while
            the rest of us gave them a listening ear. The leadership classes definitely changed my paradigm about life
            right from week one!</p>

          <p class="card-text">The very first week of this module was an amazing one. We got to learn interesting things
            about the internet and web as we got introduced to software engineering. Our facilitator Mr. Samson Kapeyi
            was a patient man and answered all our queries to get us introduced properly to the course. Overall, the
            sessions were inclusive and definitely got us more interested in learning tech!</p>

          <h4 class="card-title"><strong>WEEK TWO - Leadership</strong></h4>
          <p class="card-text">In week two, we dove deeper into the remaining 4 habits in the book "7 HABITS OF HIGHLY
            EFFECTIVE PEOPLE." This week happened to be even more interesting for me especially due to the assignment we
            were given to look for objects that best represented the essence of our mission statements. The presentation
            of these objects in our break out rooms was another emotional rollercoaster where we had to share personal
            experiences that shaped us to believe those objects best represented us. Coupled with the inspirational
            videos we watched during the classes,I managed to pick up a lot of lessons to add to my personal lifestle. I
            also had a clearer vision of where I aspire to be in the near future. It is safe to say the Leadership
            classes made me an even better leader of my life than I already was,all thanks to Ms. Julia!</p>

          <h4 class="card-title"><strong>WEEK TWO - Software Engineering</strong></h4>
          <p class="card-text">In contrast with week one, the second week was rather very challenging to most of us. We
            got deeper into details of HTML and CSS as well as Bootstrap and the Bootstrap grid system. In addition to
            those modules, we got into version control as well and had to learn how to use Git and Github. Generally, it
            was a very challenging week as we had to pick up a lot from class and take it into practice. I observed that
            majority of us became more moody as it affected our mental space too. However, our light at the end of the
            dark tunnel which we happened to be looking forward to which was the weekend, came bearing more challenging
            news. We were tasked to build personal blogs with concepts that gave us a hard time throughtout the week and
            personally, I'd planned to use the weekend to catch up on them. That was the start of my shattered weekend
            plans! As much as it was nerve wrecking to beat that deadline, the assignment got me into survival mode very
            fast and it even took me a shorter period than expected to learn what challenged me. Maybe that was my light
            at the end of the tunnel after all! It is safe to say that Samson did a perfect job in getting me situated
            for the course outline ahead and I'm forever grateful for that.</p>
